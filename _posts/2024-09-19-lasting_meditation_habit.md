I've set a new personal goal. I'm taking Marcus Aurelius's advice to heart: "We should discipline ourselves in small things, and from these progress to things of greater value." I'll start by meditating for just 5 minutes daily. As this small habit becomes ingrained, I'll gradually extend my sessions. In addition to culivating a meditation habit gradually, I'll also leverage some powerful techniques from psychology and habit formation research to reinforce my practice and increase my chances of success.

## The Three-Pronged Approach

I'm combining three powerful techniques:

1. **Mental Contrasting**: To clarify my goals and identify obstacles.
2. **Implementation Intentions**: To create specific action plans.
3. **Self-Report Habit Index (SRHI)**: To track my progress in forming the habit.

## Starting with Mental Contrasting

First, I'll use mental contrasting to really bolster my commitment to meditation. 
1. I'll vividly imagine the benefits - peace and joy.
2. I'll identify the obstacles that might prevent me from meditating. Lack of time? Agitated? Tired? 
3. I'll create if-then plans to overcome obstacles. If I encounter obstacle X, then I will respond with action Y.

## Creating Implementation Intentions

Next, I'll create a specific "if-then" plans to tackle those obstacles. For example:
- "If it's 6 AM, then I'll meditate for 10 minutes in my bedroom."
- "If I feel too busy, then I'll do a 2-minute breathing exercise at my desk."
- "If I feel overwhelmed with the plethora of meditation techniques, then fall-back on Anapanasati."
- "If I'm agitated or bored during meditation then, I'll continue meditation for at least another 10 minutes regardless of how I feel."

These concrete plans will help bridge the gap between my intentions and actions.

## Tracking Progress with SRHI

Finally, I'll use the Self-Report Habit Index to monitor how automatic my meditation practice is becoming. Every week, I'll rate statements about my meditation habit on a scale of 1-7. By tracking these scores over time, I'll be able to see my progress and adjust my approach if needed.

Here's the simplified SRHI table I'll be using:

| **Meditation is something . . .** |
|-----------------------------------|
| 1. I do frequently. |
| 2. I do automatically. |
| 3. I do without having to consciously remember. |
| 4. that makes me feel weird if I do not do it. |
| 5. I do without thinking. |
| 6. that would require effort not to do it. |
| 7. that belongs to my (daily, weekly, monthly) routine. |
| 8. I start doing before I realise I'm doing it. |
| 9. I would find hard not to do. |
| 10. I have no need to think about doing. |
| 11. that's typically "me." |
| 12. I have been doing for a long time. |

By combining mental contrasting, implementation intentions, and the SRHI, I'm setting myself up for success in establishing a lasting meditation habit. This structured approach not only increases my chances of sticking to the practice but also allows me to track my progress and make adjustments as needed.
