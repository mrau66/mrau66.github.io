## Focus, Track, and Stay Consistent
Starting a meditation practice can seem daunting, but it's really about building the right foundation. The key? Begin with single-pointed concentration using a clear, visual object like a candlelight flame. I've followed an amazing meditation and habit blog for a couple of years now: https://scienceofselfhelp.org/ The author has an interesting method to train basic samatha meditation skills. Practice this briefly but consistently, treating it like mental weight training. The author recommends four evidence-based strategies:

1. Track your sessions in a spreadsheet for accountability and motivation. Start meditation with focused concentration: visualize a simple object (like a candle flame), use a stopwatch to time how long you can maintain perfect focus, and stop the timer at the slightest distraction. Most beginners last about 8 seconds. Record your time, do two more attempts, then end the session. The key is being strict and honest with yourself about maintaining concentration.
2. Create specific if-then protocols for when you'll meditate.
3. Write out both positive and negative scenarios to mentally prepare.
4. Start small with just one minute per day, then gradually expand.

I'll be updating this tracker daily, so feel free to check back and see how I'm progressing in forming my meditation habit!
